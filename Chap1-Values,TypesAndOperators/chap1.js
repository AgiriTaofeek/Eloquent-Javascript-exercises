/*
Values and Types: JavaScript works with data represented as bits, which are organized into chunks called values. These values have different types (e.g.numbers, strings, Booleans), determining their role in a program.

Numbers: JavaScript uses 64 bits to store a single number value, allowing for a vast range of numbers but with limitations, especially when dealing with non-whole numbers.

Strings: Strings represent text and are enclosed in quotes. JavaScript uses Unicode standard to represent characters, with each character described by a sequence of bits.

Operators: Operators are used to perform operations on values. JavaScript supports various operators for arithmetic, comparison, logical operations, and more.

Special Values: JavaScript has special values like null and undefined to denote absence of meaningful data.

Type Coercion: JavaScript automatically converts values to the appropriate type when needed, but this can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior.

Logical Operators: Logical operators like && (and) and || (or) can be used to perform logical operations on Boolean values.

Short-circuiting: Logical operators employ short-circuit evaluation, where the right-hand side of the operator is evaluated only when necessary.

This text provides a foundational understanding of JavaScript's basic building blocks, preparing readers for more complex programming concepts.
